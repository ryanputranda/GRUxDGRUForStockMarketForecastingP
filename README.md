I using GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) vs DGRU (Deep Gated Recurrent Unit) to prove which the better, this is a experimental project.  I using both algorithm to forecast of stock market of BTPN Bank.  I also used Moving Average Smoothing (MAS) to smoothing the dataset which will used to training model.
